## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Iâ€™m a web developer specializing in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository showcases a collection of my work in building responsive, accessible, and cross-browser compatible websites. Whether you're looking for inspiration or solutions to common web development challenges, youâ€™ll find plenty of resources to help create modern, user-friendly web experiences.

A key focus of my work is responsive design. I ensure that every project I develop looks and works seamlessly across devices, from desktops to mobile phones. Using media queries, flexbox, and CSS Grid, I create flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. By optimizing my designs for all devices, I guarantee that users have a great experience no matter how they access the site.

Accessibility is a top priority in all my projects. I strive to make sure that my websites are usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities. I follow best practices such as proper semantic HTML, effective use of aria-labels, keyboard navigation support, and color contrast optimization. By adhering to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), I help ensure that my sites are inclusive and meet accessibility standards.

Finally, cross-browser compatibility is crucial in delivering a consistent user experience. I rigorously test my websites across multiple browsers and platforms, using tools like BrowserStack to ensure they function correctly on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. I address any inconsistencies in layout, JavaScript functionality, and CSS styling to ensure smooth performance for all users.

Feel free to explore my projects, fork them, or contribute. I hope you find these examples useful in your own web development journey. Thanks for checking out my work!
